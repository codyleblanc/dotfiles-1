Dots
====

Vim, zsh, and other configuration files. Mostly OSX specific at the moment, but will add Linux support when I require it.

I do not claim to have written all of these configurations, these are more for personal use or to be used as base for others to look at and tweak as I have done with these to make them my own.

Originally forked from https://github.com/zanshin/dotfiles because I like his ZSH configuration and the fact that it did not rely on a framework.
